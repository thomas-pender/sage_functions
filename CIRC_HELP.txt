CIRC

NAME
	circ - constructs cyclic matrix groups.

SYNOPSIS
	circ [PARAMETERS]... [OPTIONS]... [PARAMETERS | FILES]	

DESCRIPTION
	circ constructs circulant and block circulant matrices.

	MANDATORY
		At least one option from CchNn.

		-o outfile must be used for every invokation.

		-i infile must be used whenever one of CN is used.

		Expects 1 parameter: Dimension d of (block) matrix.

OPTIONS
	-C
		Constructs block circulant matrix where entry (0,1) is supplied by -i infile.

		General use: circ d -C -i infile -o outfile

	-c 
		Constructs circulant shift matrix of dimension d.

		General use: circ d -c -o outfile.

	-h
		Displays current help page.

	-N
		Constructs block negacyclic matrix where entry (0,1) is supplied by -i infile.

		General use: circ d -N -i infile -o outfile

	-n
		Constructs negacyclic shift matrix of dimension d.

		General use: circ d -n -o outfile.
